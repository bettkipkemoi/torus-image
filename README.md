This script does the following:

- Imports: It imports necessary libraries for 3D plotting.
- Parameters: Defines the major radius R and minor radius r of the torus.
- Grid: Uses np.meshgrid to create a grid of u and v values, which are angles used in the parametric equations of the torus.
- Equations: Applies parametric equations to generate x, y, and z coordinates for each point on the torus.
- Plotting: Creates a 3D plot using matplotlib, plots the surface of the torus, sets labels, and removes tick marks for a cleaner look.

When you run this script, it will open a window displaying a 3D visualization of a torus as shown below. You can adjust the R and r values to change the shape of the torus, or modify the number of points in u and v for finer or coarser detail.
